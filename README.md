# Trying Quotes
* *oh for the bigger letters i need to put "#"*
* how tf do i do the nested listings 
  1. simple yet i find hard to do it so much to learn
    2. YESS
       - i can go on 
         * listing go brr
* okay time to back to normal 
          ~~* lets see if i can do that~~
            ~~nested list again~~ 
- well turns out i couldnt do it
1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item 
       - Third nested list item
         * okay i think i mastered the nested list item
           *  so its like this 
              * yes
                * yes!
2. is it ok to nested list turn red idk
3. how the fuck am i suppose to do it
4. wait i just press enter and it goes down and i didnt need to wait what 
5. okay its true thats just normal listing but im trying to do nested listing with numbers so 
   * i can do nested lists like this yes ? 
     * yes correct then why cant i do it with the numbers that turn into letters 
       * 1. is it like this or
         * 2. this ?
           * 3. great i found it
             * 4. i actually made it
               * ***YESS*** ***okay now i wanna try it without " * " lets see if i can figure it out***
                 - 5. yeah i dont think if its possible or its because im just a newbie
                   - 6. im actually so glad i made it okay now without the letters
                   - **WHEN DOING WITH IT THE LETTERS(1./2./3.ETC.) I NEED TO LINE THE "*" WITH THE NUMBERS BECAUSE COMPUTER SEES THEM AS A CHARACTER**
                        - `lets see if i can bring more space`
                           - `yes i could and i did`
                              - and now the nested list is fucked cuz of quotes i think, trying to fix it now
                                - does it fixed?
                - i found something cool
                  - nested listing again? 
                    - it does work but what about this quoted part
                      * `lets see if i can test it again ` 
                           * `testing`  
                             * it does go back with "shift+tab" but not further idk why but it bothers me a bit 
                               * okay i can just go back with "shift+tab" and do the rest i guess 
                   * testing listing for almost 1 hour now
                     * i wanna see if i can pass the quotes with this strategy 
                       * cant find anything to write anymore im just tired 
                         * my brain is angry cuz it couldnt do what it wants to do 
                           * think i passed the quotes now lets see
                             - why cant i pass the quotes it only goes back now cuz of the "testing" quote i did ***yikes***
                             - `wait`
                             -     `what`
                             - ***I DONT KNOW HOW TO USE QUOTING CODE BUT FOR NOW THATS THE ONLY WAY I FOUND WHEN I MAKE NESTED LISTS AND QUOTING CODE FUCKS IT UP*** (3 * each side)
                             - ****1.EITHER DONT QUOTE CODE AT ALL OR IF ITS MUST THEN PRESS SPACE BAR FOUR TIMES <sup> that method will make a square around the text which does not look good but for now thats the only way i could find </sup>**** (4 * each side i think is the same as bold text)
- **now lets try the actual <sub> ***QUOTING*** </sub> with nested listing**
> - okay the text and now i wanna do the nested listing
>   - does it work
>     - yes it does work with quoting 
>        - now im a happy man
